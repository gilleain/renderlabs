Renderlabs is a meta-project of small experimental mini-projects called 'experiments'.

The organisation of the project is this:

- experiments/ = the mini project root directory
- images/      = those images necessary for the meta project
- src/         = source files of the meta project
- library/     = other projects that the experiments build on

each of the experiments should be organised as if they were a stand-alone project, so thatthey can be downloaded separately.
